\qa{What is the general name given to both FM and PM?}{Angle Modulation} 
\qa{State the effect on the amplitude of the carrier during
FM or PM.}{} 
\qa{What are the name and mathematical expressions for
the amount that the carrier varies from its unmodulated
center frequency during modulation?}{FM is proportional only to the amplitude of the modulating signal regardless of its frequency. In FM, the frequency of the modulating signal determines how many times per second the carrier frequency deviates above and below it nominal center frequency. PM, the amount of phase shift of a constant­frequency carrier is varied in accordance with a modulating signal, and the carrier frequency deviation is proportional to both the modulating frequency and the amplitude.} 
\qa{State how the frequency of a carrier varies in an FM
system when the modulating signal amplitude and
frequency change.}{As the modulating signal amplitude increases, the carrier frequency increases. If the amplitude of the modulating signal decreases, the carrier frequency decreases. The reverse relationship can be also be implemented. A decreasing modulating signal increases the carrier frequency above its center value, whereas an increasing modulating signal decreases the carrier frequency below its center value. As the modulating signal amplitude varies, the carrier frequency varies above and below its normal center, or resting, frequency with no modulation.} 
\qa{State how the frequency of a carrier varies in a PM
system when the modulating signal amplitude and
frequency change.}{As the modulating signal goes positive, the amount of phase lag, and thus the delay of the carrier output, increases with the amplitude of the modulating signal. The result at the output is the same as that if the constant­frequency carrier signal had been stretched out or had it frequency lowered. When the modulating signal goes negative, the phase shift becomes leading. This causes the carrier sine wave to be effectively speeded up, or compressed. The result is the same as if the carrier frequency has been increased} 
\qa{When does maximum frequency deviation occur in an
FM signal? A PM signal?}{For FM maximum frequency deviation occurs at the maximum amplitude of the modulating signal. For PM the maximum frequency deviation is when the modulating signal is changing most quickly, for a sine wave modulating signal, that time is when the modulating wave changes from plus to minus or from minus to plus.} 
\qa{State the conditions that must exist for a phase modula-
tor to produce FM}{deviation produced by frequency variations in the
modulating signal must be compensated for.} 
\qa{What do you call FM produced by PM techniques?}{Indirect FM} 
\qa{State the nature of the output of a phase modulator
during the time when the modulating signal voltage is
constant.}{Amplitude is constant as always, frequency is carrier frequency and the phase difference is constant, according to the constant voltage}

\qa{What is the name given to the process of phase modula-

modii ed to produce FM by PM techniques?}{deviation produced by frequency variations in the

\qa{Define narrowband FM. What criterion is used to indi-
cate NBFM?}{the FM signal occupies no more spec-
trum space than an AM signal.}

solve for the number and amplitude of sidebands in an
FM signal?}{Besel functions} 
\qa{What is the meaning of a negative sign on the sideband
value in Fig. 5-8?}{a Phase shift of 180$^o$} 
\qa{Name two ways that noise affects an FM signal}{} 
\qa{How is the noise on an FM signal minimized at the
receiver?}{limiter circuits that deliberately restrict the amplitude of the received signal. Any amplitude variations occurring on the FM signal are effectively clipped off. This does not affect the information content of the FM signal, since it is contained solely within the frequency variations of the carrier. Because of the clipping action of the limiter circuits, noise is almost completely eliminated. Even if the peaks of the FM signal itself are clipped or flattened and the resulting signal is distorted, no information is lost.} 
\qa{What is the primary advantage of FM over AM?}{	
its superior immunity to noise} 
\qa{List two additional advantages of FM over AM.}{Capture Effect ­ interfering signals on the same frequency are effectively rejected; If one signal is more than twice the amplitude of the other, the stronger signal captures the channel, totally eliminating the weaker signal.
Transmitter Efficiency ­ FM signals have a constant amplitude, and it is therefore not necessary to use linear amplifiers to increase their power level.} 
\qa{What is the nature of the noise that usually accompa-
nies a radio signal?}{} 
\qa{In what ways is an FM transmitter more efi cient than a
low-level AM transmitter? Explain.}{An FM transmitter is more efficient because the signals are already generated at a low level signal once combined with a series of highly efficient amplifiers the signal become more efficient than any low­level AM tansmitter} 
\qa{What is the main disadvantage of FM over AM? State
two ways in which this disadvantage can be overcome.}{Excessive Spectrum Use and Circuit Complexity} 
\qa{What type of power amplifier is used to amplify FM
signals? Low-level AM signals?}{} 
\qa{What is the name of the receiver circuit that eliminates
noise?}{} 
\qa{What is the capture effect and what causes it?}{capture effect is the effect caused by two or more FM signals occurring simultaneously on the same frequency. The stronger signal captures the channel, eliminating the weaker channel.} 
\qa{What is the nature of the modulating signals that are
most negatively affected by noise on an FM signal?}{}
