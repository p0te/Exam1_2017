# Welcome to my notes for 2017's June exams


Repo for my notes in the sem1 exam for 2017. 

## Using git in stead of downloading from  github(reccomended)
### why?
You have a folder on your PC that syncs all the latesr changes in the repository
without opening a browser window. You don;t even need a github account.
### how
Install git, set up to run from command line. https://git-for-windows.github.io/Open a folder that you want synced with the repo.
Open a command shell in that folder and execute: "git pull https://github.com/p0te/Exam1_2017.git". That's it. Everytime you execute that command the latest content will be pulled using minimal bandwidth (since git detects changes)
